WordPress TinyMCE Editor Button Example
========================================
This is a small, but functional, WordPress plugin. It adds a button to the WordPress
TinyMCE editor's toolbar which, when clicked, opens a dialog window.  This dialog
window then inserts a shortcode in the editor.

This plugin was created to accompany a post on my website that I am writing to help
my fellow developers utilize TinyMCE to it's fullest in their WordPress plugins.


The source code is *heavily* commented and documented throughout.  If
you have a basic understanding of WordPress plugin design and have some exposure
to TinyMCE, you can probably figure this out pretty easily from the code.  I recommend
you start with *tinymce-dev-starter.php*, then move to *tinymce-plugin.js*, and finally,
end with *tinymce-dialog.html*.

However, as I mentioned, it is an accompaniement to a tutorial. Check out the
tutorial for a step-by-step walkthrough:
